General practitioners (GPs) are aware of their key position in relation to prescribing practice in the elderly. However, they often feel powerless and report a need for simple GP friendly tools to assess and support their prescribing practice.\n\nObjectives: \nIn this study such a t...",

However, the molecular and cellular pathways by which sleep need is encoded are poorly understood. In addition, the mechanisms underlying both how and when sleep need is transformed to sleep drive are unknown. Here, using ex vivo and in...",
