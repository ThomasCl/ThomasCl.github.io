Ook onderzoekt hij de effecten van verschillende interventies op het ontwikkelingstal van kinderen. Jan D'hooge is gespecialiseerd in de ontwikkeling van cognitieve en sociale vaardigheden, en is bekend om zijn inzicht in de complexiteit van ontwikkelingsstoornissen en zijn inspanningen om een meer verplichtende benadering te ontwikkelen voor het ondersteunen van kinderen en jongvolwassenen. Zijn werk heeft een grote invloed gehad op de manier waarop ontwikkelingsstoornissen worden behandeld en onderzocht in Belgi\u00eb en daarbuiten.",

Ze specialiseert zich in de studie van ijskoekels en hun invloed op wolkeneigenschappen, met name in Dronning Maud Land, Oost-Antarctica. Haar onderzoek richt zich op het vergroten van het begrip van hoe ijskoekels de vorming van wolken be\u00efnvloeden en hoe dit kan leiden tot veranderingen in de klimaatvoorspellingen. Daarnaast werkt ze aan het ontwikkelen van modellen voor het voorspellen van de effecten van atmosferische golfgolven op windturbines.
